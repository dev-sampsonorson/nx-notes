# Utility Libraries

A utility contains common utilities/services used by many libraries. Often there is no `ngModule` and the library is simply a collection of utilities or pure functions.

### Naming Convention

`util` (if nested), or `util-*` (e.g., util-testing)

### Example ui lib module

*libs/shared/util-formatting*
