# Creating an App

```
ng generate app myapp
ng generate application myapp # same thing
```

This command executes a few actions:
1. It creates a new app, places it in the apps directory, and configures the `angular.json` and `nx.json` files to support the new app.
2. It configures the root `NgModule` to import the `NxModule` code so we can take advantage of things like `DataPersistence`.
3. It also provides an `e2e` sibling folder for this app that contains the `e2e` testing code.

### Options Different from Angular CLI

- directory
- routing
- tags

- `ng generate app myapp --directory=myteam` creates a new application in `apps/myteam/myapp`
- `ng generate app myapp --routing` configures the root `NgModule` to wire up routing, as well as add a `<router-outlet>` to the `AppComponent` template to help get us started.
- `ng generate app myapp --tags=scope:shared,type:app` annotates the created app with the two tags, which can be used for advanced code analysis.
