# UI Libraries

A UI library is a collection of related presentational components. There are generally no services injected into these components (all of the data they need should come from Inputs).

### Naming Convention

`ui` (if nested) or `ui-*` (e.g. ui-buttons)

### Example

The path to this module would be `libs/common/ui-buttons/src/common-ui-buttons.module.ts`
