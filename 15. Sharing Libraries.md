# Sharing Libraries

Shared libraries are a great way to save the developer time and effort by reusing a solution to a common problem.

Letâ€™s consider our reference monorepo. The shared-data-access library contains the code needed to communicate with the back-end (For example, the URL prefix). We know that this would be the same for all libs; therefore, we should place this in the shared lib and properly document it so that all projects can use it instead of writing their own versions.
