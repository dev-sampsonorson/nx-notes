# Feature Libraries

- Contains a set of files that configure a buisness use case or a page. 
- Contains an ngModule that specifies how this part of the application behaves (may contain a slice of the Store, handle its own routing within a particular application section, and can be lazy loaded into an app). 
- Most components are smart components that interact with the NgRx Store
- Contains most of the UI logic
- Form validation
- Almost always app-specific and are often lazy-loaded

### Naming Convention

`feature` (if nested) or `feature-*` (e.g. `feature-shell`). `feature-shell` is the app-specific feature library (in this case, the "booking" app).
