# Creating a Workspace

`npm install -g @angular/cli @nrwl/schematics`

This creates a new Nx Workspace using a sandboxed environment and running the Angular CLI's `ng new` command under the hood with the Nx schematics collection.

```
npx create-nx-workspace myworkspacename
npx create-nx-workspace@latest myworkspacename
npx create-nx-workspace --preset=angular

```

### Install Nx CLI

```
npm install -g nx
```

You can also add Nx capabilities to an existing CLI project by running:

`ng add @nrwl/schematics`

Regardless of how you create a workspace, what you end up with is a Nx Workspace with the following files/folders created.

A short description of each of them is below; we expand on each of them as we progress through
the book.
- **apps/**: This is where all the apps and e2e folders reside
- **libs/**: This is where libraries are placed
- **tools/**: This is used for tooling e.g. workspace schematics
- **angular.json**: This is used by the Angular CLI to describe the projects (apps and libs), how to build and test them, etc.
- **nx.json**: This is used by Nx to provide metadata for projects e.g. tags
- **tslint.json**: This is the linter configuration file
- **tsconfig.json**: This is the workspace tsconfig. Nx adds path aliases for each lib here to allow for workspace-relative imports e.g. `import { myLib } from '@myProject/shared/my-lib';`
