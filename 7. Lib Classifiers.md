# Lib Classifiers

Every library should be located in the folder tree by scope, have tags that are in the format `scope:SCOPE,type:TYPE,platform:PLATFORM` as above, and have a prefix by its type.

There a two basic classifiers: `scope` and `type`. There can be additional classifiers in order to help with different scenarios in a particular organization for example, `platform`.

### Scope

Relates to a `logical grouping`, `business use-case`, or `domain`.  

Example; `seatmap`, `booking`, `shared`, and `check-in`. They contain libraries that manage a sub-domain of application logic.

**Use folder structure to denote scope**: The following folder structure is an example scope hierarchy used to describe the seatmap feature:

Here, "shared" and "seatmap" are grouping folders, and `feature` is a library that is nested two levels deep. This offers a clear indication that this feature belongs to a domain of `seatmap` which is a sub-domain of `shared` items.

The tag used in this library would be `scope:shared`, as this is the top-level scope.

First, use your project configuration (within `project.json` or `workspace.json`) to annotate your projects with `tags`. In this example, we will use three tags: `scope:client`. `scope:admin`, `scope:shared`.

```
// project "client"
{
  // ... more project configuration here

  "tags": ["scope:client"]
}

// project "client-e2e"
{
  // ... more project configuration here

  "tags": ["scope:client"],
  "implicitDependencies": ["client"]
}

// project "client-feature-main"
{
  // ... more project configuration here

  "tags": ["scope:client"]
},

// project "admin-feature-permissions"
{
  // ... more project configuration here

  "tags": ["scope:admin"]
}

// project "components-shared"
{
  // ... more project configuration here

  "tags": ["scope:shared"]
}
```

### Type

Limit the types to; `feature`, `ui`, `data-access`, `utility`

Type relates to;

- library content
- library purpose
- library usage

Examples of types are `ui`, `data-access`, and `feature`. 

The folder name for this feature would be `feature-shell` so that it uses the prefix for its library type.

The tag for the seatmap feature library as in the previous example would now be `scope:shared,type:feature.`

### Platform

There can be other classifiers used to differentiate between similar libraries (e.g. between `server`, `mobile`, and `desktop`). Platform is one such classifier.

The final tag for the seatmap feature would be `scope:shared,type:feature,platform:desktop`.

### Donâ€™t Organize by file type!

We strongly discourage organization by file type e.g. `directives/`, `services/`, etc. The reason for this is that when we are looking to make a change, we often need to change a few related files at once. When organizing by file type we need to traverse the folder tree multiple times to locate the needed files.

Rather we suggest that the code base be organized by `domain` and include all the related files together e.g. `airline` which includes state, ui components, etc. inside a single grouping folder. This allows a developer to work on related files without needing to traverse the folder tree often.
