# Grouping Folders

In our reference structure, the folders `libs/booking`, `libs/check-in`, `libs/shared`, and `libs/shared/seatmap` are grouping folders. They do not contain anything except other library or grouping folders.

The purpose of these folders is to help with organizing by scope.

We recommend grouping libraries together which are (usually) updated together. It helps with minimizing the amount of time a developer spends navigating the folder tree to find the right file.
