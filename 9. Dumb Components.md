# Dumb Components

**ui libraries contain presentational components**

Only receive data (known as "presentational" or "dumb" components)

- Very little or no business logic
- They only rely on Inputs and Outputs to communicate with the outside
- Only purpose to render data and accept user input - **not to process input** Rather, these components emit events via Outputs to parent components which know how to handle them.
- They are highly reusable and are the easiest to test and may be fully generic/domain-agnostic (e.g,. data-table) or have a domain-context (e.g, log-book-table).
