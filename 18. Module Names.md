# Module Names

The main module for a library must contain the full path (relative to libs) within the filename. e.g. the main module for the library `libs/booking/feature-destination` would have the module filename as `booking-feature-destination.module.ts.`

This is the way that the CLI creates the modules and we are recommending that we keep this pattern.
