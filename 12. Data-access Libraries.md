# Data-access Libraries

Data-access libraries contain REST or webSocket services that function as client-side delegate layers to server tier APIs.

All files related to State management also reside in a data-access folder (by convention, they can be grouped under a `+state` folder under `src/lib`).

### Naming Convention

`data-access` (if nested) or `data-access-*` (e.g. data-access-seatmap)

### Example

Again, notice that we only use `.forFeature` in libs. Any `.forRoot` calls should be in apps.
