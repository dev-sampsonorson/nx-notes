# Library

Some libararies are used only by a particular app (e.g. booking) and should go into the appropriate directory (e.g. libs/booking). We call them "app-specific".

The goal of creating "app-specific" libraries is not for code reuse, but factoring the application into well-defined modules to simplify the application's maintenance.
