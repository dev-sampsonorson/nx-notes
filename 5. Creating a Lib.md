# Creating a Lib

This creates a new lib, places it in the `libs` directory, and configures the `angular.json` and `nx.json` files to support the new lib.

```
ng generate lib mylib
ng generate library mylib # same thing
npx nx g @nrwl/angular:lib ui
```

When creating lazy-loaded libraries, you need to add an entry to the `tsconfig.app.json` file of the parent module app, so TypeScript knows to build it as well:
